- This is the default team that plays.
myTeam.py
-  This is where you define your own agents for inclusion in the tournament. (This is the only file that you submit.)
- Must have create team function (Rename the selected agents though)
- Must have agent classes that inherit from CaptureAgent, which has functions registerInitialState and chooseAction


initial agent functionality
- Offensive
	- Play fairly greedy, but at a certain threshold (~5 pellots or ~%10) reached, go back and score points
	- Something to maybe know if its being chased and how close an enemy is to it. If so play safer (go back to base).
		- Is it closer to base or to a powerpellet?
		- Possible method to determine being chased: Get previous state and current state of enemies, and calculate whether they have moved closer to you or if their direction is pointing towards you. Each turn.
		- If being chased don't taking any turns that lead you to a dead end.
	- If have a lead (~%5 point lead at least)? then play defense. Maybe a soft offense and defense
	- Should we gun for power pellot?
- Defensive
	- Should play safe offense by defualt (No enemies in base). Hunt for pellets in the first ~3 columns of enemy territory
	- Otherwise, play similar to the baseline defense and hunt enemies in base.
	- Maybe play around power pellots, or around border?
- Power pellet
	- Don't count towards score
- More things to consider
	- Avoid ghosts on path back to base.
	- While no pacman on our side 
		- Defense should stay near center of arena and ideally around pellet. (If 
		- If two on defense, one should stay near top, and other near bottom.

	- Maybe get greedier the more the other team scores.
